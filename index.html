                    resolved solely and exclusively by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may
                    assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal

                <p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
                    However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court
                    (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of
                    this Agreement as a court would.</p>
                <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your
                    claim to the following address: Suite 220, 7455 Arroyo Crossing, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA 89113.</p>
                <p>Arbitration under this Agreement will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA)
                    under its rules then in effect, and shall be located in Las Vegas, Nevada. Payment of all filing,
                    administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules.</p>
                <p>You and us agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual
                    basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds
                    in court rather than in arbitration, both you and us agree that parties have each waived any right
                    to a jury trial.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or

                <p>To the extent arbitrations does not apply, you agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to
                    the Services, or to us, may only be brought by you in a state or federal court located in District
                    of Las Vegas, Nevada. YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THIS VENUE AS INCONVENIENT OR INAPPROPRIATE,
                    AND AGREE TO EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE IN THE DISTRICT OF NEVADA</p>
